# YoutubeUnblocker
youtube unblocker, youtube videos, and more.
# First Method
Step one: Search up html compiler on your search engine and go to one unblocked
Step two: Type in this code (Using Mrbeast link as example) <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/watch?v=l-nMKJ5J3Uc" height="100%" width="100%></iframe> (HAS to include the /embed/ like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-nMKJ5J3Uc, https://www.youtube.com/[put /embed/]/watch?v=l-nMKJ5J3Uc, https://www.youtube.com/embed/watch?v=l-nMKJ5J3Uc
Step three (If needed): Press run and then press play
#Method Two
Go to google docs, create a google doc, and put your youtube link into your docs. From there you want to click on the link and **dont go to the youtube link**, press open in preview and you can fullscreen from there.
#Method Three
Use a proxy like surfskip (Probaly the best proxy out there). Then type https://youtube.com/ into the url bar **INSIDE THE PROXY**. Here is a link https://technologyhelp.afro2.com.br/ (Free but Might be Down) or https://251.12.49.34.bc.googleusercontent.com/ (Premium)

#More stuff
More school stuff I thought that helped me down below\
#Lanschool Air Disable (how they see your browser)
Killing lanschool (air) is easy (**only on chrome**)
Go to your side bar and right click on lanschool air, then press close. The app will open back up but it will say "**Not Connected**" (Which means its off)
#Extension killer
Go to https://github.com/Egduffuu/ExtHanger/blob/main/maincontent.html (Not Mine) and download the maincontent.html file then open it. After you open it select your extension and press hang, Then follow the instructions below the hang button at the bottom of the page.
#Unblocked Website
Use either vercel.ciom to host github files or use replit to host it (Replit is not the best hosting platform, Use vercel is its not blocked) If the vercel.com website is blocked 
try using a proxy or a diffrent device to generate links with a diffrent sub-domain (and it is probaly unblocked) You can use ArtClass v4, or Interstellar, Or Snorlaxes Cave, 
or mostly anything on github.
#3KH0
